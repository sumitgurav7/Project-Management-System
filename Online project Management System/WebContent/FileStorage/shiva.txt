I ordered usb sound card and acne cream from you..... and it was supposed to be delivered yesterday........ i was eagerly waiting for  the same....... but now it is showing that its delayed as per customers request...........
and yesterday i contacted your executive regarding this ..... he said that it will be delivered...... and look now its showing it will be delivered by 26 of june.......... its new policy i think...... tell customer that you have requested us to delay ypour delivery and delay it by 2-3 days.............. why are you doing this by the way
no such request has made from our side and no call from delivery person has been received by me or by any of my family and friends......... and top of that its saturday, I dont want any excuse such as tomorrow is Sunday and such bullshit...... I didnt asked you to delay my product........ any how you have to deliver my product till tomorrow.......... the irony is I am prime customer and facing such problem......... thanks for such incredible service...... hats off




I placed an order on 23rd june 2017 for Safrogel Saffron Gel . I have paid for the same. I was expecting my order sooner as its been more than a 4 days. I haven't received any confirmation or any processing notification from your side.... I needed that product as soon as possible...... please check same and reply ASAP
